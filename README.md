# hello-world
My idea sandbox on GitHub.

Hi there! I've been coding off and on since I was twelve, running my VIC20 out of memory. Have dabbled offa and on now for nearly 40 years. It is not a profession, but I have found code so helpful to solve problems at work that just aren't easily fixed with applications. And it is just fascinating and fun to me.

I hope to get assistance along my latest quest, learning C# and using APIs.
